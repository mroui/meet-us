## Introduction
**MeetUs** is an web application which is kind of an **events calendar** with a chat messenger function. 
</br>
Each user can **create his own account**, **add event, meetup** and **browse those added by the others** with **chat option**, which is assigned to each created event. Every chat is **placed in specific area by pin on a map**.
</br>
**Events**, in the meaning those **greater** like concerts, presentations or those **smaller, more private** like running together, looking for people for a trip etc. It can be any kind or category - *anything for what you need to gather people*.
</br>
**The chat** is so useful, that it allows to **create a community** with people with **common interests**, **meet new people**, **ask questions** and **discuss**. What is more, all of this creates an **archive** - events can be reactivated and **all photos, all discussions will be waiting for old and the new one participants**.
</br>
Every event can be **searched by set filters** (and then **sorted** by basic values) or by **searching on a real map**.
</br>
A user without an account has **limited functions** reduced to viewing events and participating in chats. Access to all of the features has person with **created account**. More options related to **event management** is available when user set up his own event.
</br>
To help users obtain informations about events, there is available a **helpbot that responds to special commands**.
</br>
**Community is created by members**, their **messages** and also **photos** which they can share by send url. It is also available to use **emoji** to express users' emotions more clearly. :blush: :heart:
</br>
Project includes **client** side *(React + ES6)* and also **server** side *(Node.js (Typescript) + GraphQL)* communicating with each other by *Apollo GraphQL*.
</br>
An application was tested with *node.js 10* and corresponding *npm 6*.
</br>
For the proper operation of an application, **internet connection is required** and **access location permission**.
</br>
*Project was made as a part of an internship education in [TDSoft](https://tdsoft.pl). Developers from company have created a basic chat application with geolocation and basic database. My task was to expand the whole project with my own idea.*
